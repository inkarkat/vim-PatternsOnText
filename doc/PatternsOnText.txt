DESCRIPTION					  *PatternsOnText-description*

This plugin provides a toolbox of commands to delete, substitute, or
de-duplicate text based on a passed regular expression (or the last used
search pattern), something which would otherwise require multiple steps, a
complex |sub-replace-expression| or a macro. One way or the other, all
commands here are extensions of the |:substitute| command. Use them whenever
the general built-in doesn't suffice.

==============================================================================
USAGE							*PatternsOnText-usage*
							   *:SubstituteExcept*
:[range]SubstituteExcept/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]
			Replace instances of text in the current line /
			[range] that do not match {pattern} / the last used
			search pattern with {string}; "g" is implicit. Empty
			lines (without any whitespace) are kept empty.
			In {string}, & refers to the text that does not match,
			whereas \1 etc. refer to the previous match of a
			sub-expression in {pattern}.
:[range]SubstituteExcept [flags] [count]
			Repeat the last substitution with the last used search
			pattern, last used replacement string, and last used
			|:s_flags|; "g" is implicit.
							       *:DeleteExcept*
:[range]DeleteExcept [{pattern}]
:[range]DeleteExcept /{pattern}/[flags]
			Delete all text in the current line / [range] except
			for the text matching {pattern} / the last used search
			pattern. For [flags], see |:s_flags|; "g" is implicit.


							 *:SubstituteSelected*
:[range]SubstituteSelected/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] {answers}
			Replace matches of {pattern} in the current line /
			[range] with {string}, determining whether a
			particular match should be replaced on the sequence of
			"y" or "n" (a count can be prefixed, e.g. "3y4n2y") or
			numeric positions "2,5", or ranges "3-5" in {answers}.
			If no numeric positions follow, the last "y" / "n"
			sequence repeats for further matches. For example with
			"ynn", the first match is replaced, the second and
			third are not, the fourth is again replaced, ...
			Handles & and \0, \1 .. \9 in {string}.
:[range]SubstituteSelected [flags] [answers]
			Repeat the last substitution with the last used search
			pattern, last used replacement string, last used
			|:s_flags|, and last used answers.

							 *:SubstituteInSearch*
:[range]SubstituteInSearch/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]
			Within the current search pattern matches, replace all
			matches of {pattern} with {string}. Shortcut for >
			:%s//\=substitute(submatch(0), "foo", "bar", "g")/gc
<			~ is replaced with the {string} of the previous
			:SubstituteInSearch.
			[flags] and [count] apply to the outer matching of the
			last search pattern. The [e] from |:s_flags| also
			suppresses the error message when {pattern} never
			matches.
			To replace only the first occurrence of {pattern},
			pass the special flag [f].
			For a case-insensitive substitution, prepend '\c' to
			{pattern}.
			Does not modify the last search pattern |quote/|.
:[range]SubstituteInSearch [flags] [count]
			Repeat last :SubstituteInSearch with same search
			pattern and substitute string, but without the same
			flags.


						      *:PrintDuplicateLinesOf*
:[range]PrintDuplicateLinesOf[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]PrintDuplicateLinesOf[!] /{pattern}/
			Print all occurrences of lines matching {pattern} (or
			the current line, if omitted).
			All matching lines are added to the |jumplist|, so you
			can use |CTRL-O| to revisit the locations.
						     *:DeleteDuplicateLinesOf*
:[range]DeleteDuplicateLinesOf[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]DeleteDuplicateLinesOf[!] /{pattern}/
			Delete all subsequent occurrences of lines matching
			{pattern} (with . the current line; if omitted: the
			last search pattern).

						*:PrintDuplicateLinesIgnoring*
:[range]PrintDuplicateLinesIgnoring[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]PrintDuplicateLinesIgnoring[!] /{pattern}/
			Print all occurrences of a line whose text (ignoring
			any text matched by {pattern} appears multiple times.
			All matching lines are added to the |jumplist|, so you
			can use |CTRL-O| to revisit the locations.
					       *:DeleteDuplicateLinesIgnoring*
:[range]DeleteDuplicateLinesIgnoring[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]DeleteDuplicateLinesIgnoring[!] /{pattern}/
			Delete all subsequent occurrences of a line (ignoring
			any text matched by {pattern}.

							    *:PrintDuplicates*
:[range]PrintDuplicates[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]PrintDuplicates[!] /{pattern}/
			Print all matches of {pattern} (if omitted: the last
			search pattern) that appear multiple times in the
			current line / [range].
			To print all duplicate matches of {pattern} within a
			single line, processing a [range] or the entire
			buffer, use: >
			:global/^/PrintDuplicates! [{pattern}]
			:global/^/PrintDuplicates! /{pattern}/
<			The [!] suppresses the error when there are no
			duplicates in a particular line.
							   *:DeleteDuplicates*
:[range]DeleteDuplicates[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]DeleteDuplicates[!] /{pattern}/
			Delete all subsequent matches of {pattern} (or the
			last search pattern, if omitted) except the first.

INSTALLATION					 *PatternsOnText-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim PatternsOnText*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					 *PatternsOnText-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.007 or
  higher.

HISTORY						      *PatternsOnText-history*

1.12	RELEASEME
- Minor: Make substitute() and matchlist() robust against 'ignorecase'.
- FIX: Use of \v and \V magicness atoms in the pattern for :DeleteExcept and
  :SubstituteExcept cause errors like "E54: Unmatched (" and "E486: Pattern
  not found". Revert to the default 'magic' mode after each pattern insertion
  to the workhorse regular expression.
- FIX: Abort :DeleteExcept / :SubstituteExcept commands when the pattern
  contains the set start / end match patterns \zs / \ze, as these interfere
  with the internal implemenation.

1.11	13-Jun-2013
- FIX: Remove -bar from all commands to correctly handle patterns like
  foo\|bar without escaping as foo\\|bar.
- :SubstituteSelected now positions the cursor on the line where the last
  selected replacement happened, to behave like :substitute.

1.10	06-Jun-2013
- ENH: :SubstituteSelected handles count before "y" and "n" answers, numeric
  positions "2,5", and ranges "3-5".
- Also recall previous answers in a bare :SubstituteSelected command.
- The commands that take a {pattern}, i.e. :SubstituteExcept, :DeleteExcept,
  :SubstituteSelected now consistently set that as the last search pattern.
- Refactoring: Move functions from ingo/cmdargs.vim to
  ingo/cmdargs/pattern.vim and ingo/cmdargs/substitute.vim.
  *** You need to update to ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.007! ***

1.01	30-May-2013
Implement abort on error for :SubstituteExcept, :DeleteExcept,
:SubstituteSelected, and :SubstituteInSearch, too.

1.00	29-May-2013
First published version.

0.01	12-Sep-2011
Started development as part of my custom ingocommands.

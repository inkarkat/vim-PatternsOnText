DESCRIPTION					  *PatternsOnText-description*

This plugin provides a toolbox of commands to delete, substitute, or
de-duplicate text based on a passed regular expression (or the last used
search pattern), something which would otherwise require multiple steps, a
complex |sub-replace-expression| or a macro. One way or the other, all
commands here are extensions of the |:substitute| command. Use them whenever
the general built-in doesn't suffice.

- The |ExtractMatches.vim| plugin (vimscript #0000) provides commands to yank
  matches into a register, optionally only unique matches without duplicates.

==============================================================================
USAGE							*PatternsOnText-usage*
							   *:SubstituteExcept*
:[range]SubstituteExcept/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]
			Replace instances of text in the current line /
			[range] that do not match {pattern} / the last used
			search pattern with {string}; "g" is implicit. Empty
			lines (without any whitespace) are kept empty.
			In {string}, & refers to the text that does not match,
			whereas \1 etc. refer to the previous match of a
			sub-expression in {pattern}.
:[range]SubstituteExcept
			Repeat the last :SubstituteExcept with the last used
			search pattern, last used replacement string (also
			from a |:substitute|), and last used |:s_flags|; "g"
			is implicit.
							       *:DeleteExcept*
:[range]DeleteExcept [{pattern}]
:[range]DeleteExcept /{pattern}/[flags]
			Delete all text in the current line / [range] except
			for the text matching {pattern} / the last used search
			pattern. For [flags], see |:s_flags|; "g" is implicit.


							 *:SubstituteSelected*
:[range]SubstituteSelected/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] {answers}
			Replace matches of {pattern} in the current line /
			[range] with {string}, determining whether a
			particular match should be replaced on the sequence of
			"y" or "n" in {answers}. For example with "ynn", the
			first match is replaced, the second and third are not,
			the fourth is again replaced, ...
			Handles & and \0, \1 .. \9 in {string}.

							 *:SubstituteInSearch*
:[range]SubstituteInSearch/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]
			Within the current search pattern matches, replace all
			matches of {pattern} with {string}. Shortcut for >
			:%s//\=substitute(submatch(0), "foo", "bar", "g")/gc
<			~ is replaced with the {string} of the previous
			:SubstituteInSearch.
			[flags] and [count] apply to the outer matching of the
			last search pattern. The [e] from |:s_flags| also
			suppresses the error message when {pattern} never
			matches.
			To replace only the first occurrence of {pattern},
			pass the special flag [f].
			For a case-insensitive substitution, prepend '\c' to
			{pattern}.
:[range]SubstituteInSearch [flags] [count]
			Repeat last :SubstituteInSearch with same search
			pattern and substitute string, but without the same
			flags.


						      *:PrintDuplicateLinesOf*
:[range]PrintDuplicateLinesOf[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]PrintDuplicateLinesOf[!] /{pattern}/
			Print all occurrences of lines matching {pattern} (or
			the current line, if omitted).
			All matching lines are added to the |jumplist|, so you
			can use |CTRL-O| to revisit the locations.
						     *:DeleteDuplicateLinesOf*
:[range]DeleteDuplicateLinesOf[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]DeleteDuplicateLinesOf[!] /{pattern}/
			Delete all subsequent occurrences of lines matching
			{pattern} (with . the current line; if omitted: the
			last search pattern).

						*:PrintDuplicateLinesIgnoring*
:[range]PrintDuplicateLinesIgnoring[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]PrintDuplicateLinesIgnoring[!] /{pattern}/
			Print all occurrences of a line whose text (ignoring
			any text matched by {pattern} appears multiple times.
			All matching lines are added to the |jumplist|, so you
			can use |CTRL-O| to revisit the locations.
					       *:DeleteDuplicateLinesIgnoring*
:[range]DeleteDuplicateLinesIgnoring[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]DeleteDuplicateLinesIgnoring[!] /{pattern}/
			Delete all subsequent occurrences of a line (ignoring
			any text matched by {pattern}.

							    *:PrintDuplicates*
:[range]PrintDuplicates[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]PrintDuplicates[!] /{pattern}/
			Print all matches of {pattern} (if omitted: the last
			search pattern) that appear multiple times in the
			current line / [range].
			To print all duplicate matches of {pattern} within a
			single line, processing a [range] or the entire
			buffer, use: >
			:global/^/PrintDuplicates! [{pattern}]
			:global/^/PrintDuplicates! /{pattern}/
<			The [!] suppresses the error when there are no
			duplicates in a particular line.
							   *:DeleteDuplicates*
:[range]DeleteDuplicates[!] [{pattern}]
:[range]DeleteDuplicates[!] /{pattern}/
			Delete all subsequent matches of {pattern} (or the
			last search pattern, if omitted) except the first.

INSTALLATION					 *PatternsOnText-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim PatternsOnText*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					 *PatternsOnText-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.006 or
  higher.
